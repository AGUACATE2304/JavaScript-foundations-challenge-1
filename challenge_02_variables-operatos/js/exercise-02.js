    1. Declare a variable using let with any name you like, but without a value.
    2. On a separate line, assign the variable the String: "Moo!"
    3. Log out this variable to the terminal using console.log
    
    Repeat the above steps but try using a const variable. Comment this new part of code and explain what is happening.

console.log(letVariable);

// I comented the code, because it appears and error

/*
const constVariable;
constVariable ="Moo!";
conosle.log(constVariable);

A Syntax Error apears, because const is a type of variable that need to be initialized at first,
and can not be changed or reasigned.
This means that you can not declare a const and in an other line change his value;

## About operators

### Which are the main comparison operators in JS? Explain them with at least one example for primitive.

```
Equality (==): 
    let x = 5;
    let y = "5";

    console.log(x == y);


Inequality (!=): 
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;

    console.log(a != b);

Strict Equality (===):
    let p = 5;
    let q = 5;
    
    console.log(p === q);

Strict Inequality (!==):
    let m = 10;
    let n = "10";

    console.log(m !== n);

Greater Than (>):
    let price1 = 25;
    let price2 = 20;

    console.log(price1 > price2);

Less Than (<):
    let score1 = 85;
    let score2 = 90;

    console.log(score1 < score2);

Greater Than or Equal To (>=):
    let value1 = 100;
    let value2 = 100;

    console.log(value1 >= value2);

Less Than or Equal To (<=): 
    let temperature1 = 15;
    let temperature2 = 20;

    console.log(temperature1 <= temperature2); 

```

### Which are the main logical operators in JS? Explain them with at least one example for primitive.

```
Logical AND (&&):
    let isSunny = true;
    let isWarm = true;

    let goOutside = isSunny && isWarm;
    console.log(goOutside);

Logical OR (||):
    let isWeekend = false;
    let isHoliday = true;

    let planVacation = isWeekend || isHoliday;
    console.log(planVacation);

Logical NOT (!):
    let isRainy = true;

    let takeUmbrella = !isRainy;
    console.log(takeUmbrella);
```
